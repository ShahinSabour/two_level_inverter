### Description

The Sace Vector Modulation (SVM) technique is a digital modulating technique which generates PWM based on the vector representation. These
digital signals are given directly to switches which are controlled as per vector representation. The vectors are placed
in hexagonal structure for representing magnitudes and phases of each vector. The SVM which is represented in α-β
frame is the conventional technique.
